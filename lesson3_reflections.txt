When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you have other contributors or are using different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You only want pull changes after you review them

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork = clone from a GitHub repo to another - used to add or modify someone's repo in your own remote
clone = a copy of a repo to another location - used to get a local copy of someone's repo
branch = a branch in the selected repo - use when adding features that you dont want to commit to master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline on changes to last known state

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Keeping file names different from other users, but it would be hard to track changes
